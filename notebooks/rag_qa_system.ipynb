One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won't be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that's mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\n",

Using the checkerboard motif that appears throughout his work, Nahusenay probes the Biblical passage, which illustrates the drunken gambling and revelry that took place underneath the cross during the Crucifixion. Using rows upon rows of black and white squares and etchings, he takes this meditation to a more secular context, as the alternating squares sinuously trace the calm repose of a woman seated behind a café table, clasping her mobile phone.\n",

            "Arfe illustrates the classical Orders based on Serlio, adding a sixth ‘Attic’ order, and treats various aspects of architectural ornament. At the time of its publication, the Varia was only the second original architectural treatise composed in Spanish – following Diego de Sagredo’s famed Medidas del Romano (1526) and derivative works of translation such as Villalpando’s Tercero y Quarto libro de Serlio (1552), Zamorano’s Diez Libros de Architectura of Alberti (1582), Miguel de Urrea’s Vitruvio (1582) (Fajardo, 130; Bonet Correa, 158). “Arfe’s treatise, with its more timeless character, transcended its own era” (Bonet Correa, 158). Although the Medidas del Romano of Diego Sagredo appeared in three Spanish editions and further French and Portuguese translations, its emphasis on the ‘Plateresque’ style of architecture contributed to the waning of its popularity during the 17th century, even as the popularity of Arfe’s treatise increased.\n",

It contains a very big variety of coins from different countries. The collection, which covers the period from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century AD, is a fascinating record of civilization in the process of change as religions merged and society evolved. Also the museum contains hundreds of precious antiques. Then proceed to visit the catacomb of Kom El-Shuqafa which is one of Alexandria most memorable monuments. Kom El-Shuqafa meaning “Mound of Shards” or “Potsherds.” Its actual ancient Egyptian name was Ra-Qedil. The catacombs are unique both for their plan and for its decoration which represents a melding and mixing of the cultures and traditions of the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans.\n",

The present copy, intriguingly, carries the apparent signature of Arphe himself on the bottom margin of the title page. This exact signature is also present in the same location in copies now at the Biblioteca Nacional de España and the Biblioteca de Castilla y Léon (effaced), a detail which might shed further light on the early publication history of the Varia. * Palau 16055; Adams A2003; CCBE s.

I found it on the side of a mountain in Montana near Bozeman a bunch of years back. It was Ina large chunk of what I assumed to be granite. I chipped out the little piece you see here with the aid on another large rock and some significant luck. The blue crystal is somewhat faceted. I've always held out hope that I had found a Montana sapphire, but I was never sure. Since it's so tiny, I know it isn't worth anything, but I thought it was beautiful nonetheless. any ideas? Thanks! Definitely not sapphire, looks like a bit of mineral stain in the quartz (not sure what it is).\n",

            "Where do you stay in The City? I should first make clear that New York, or more specifically Manhattan, is “The City.” This is not a statement of arrogance or superiority. It is simply tradition. I grew up in one of the communities that sprang up on Long Island in the first decade after the end of World War II.\n",

            "The old line runs north–south between Athens (suburb of Kifissia) and Piraeus daily 0500-0015. There are also two new lines: Line 2 runs between Aghios Antonios and Aghios Dimitrios and line 3 runs between Monastiraki and the airport. Tickets can be bought at every Metro and ISAP station. Information on timetables and schedules are available from Athens Metro or OASA (see address details above). A new tram system in Athens cuts through the city from Syntagma Square right through to the coast and runs a pleasurable route from Peace and Friendship Stadium all the way to the most southern point of Glyfada. Tickets can be booked at all stations and trams connect with the Metro at Neos Kosmos and Neo Faliro (website: ww.tramsa.gr). The following chart gives approximate travel times (in hours and minutes) from Athens to other major cities/islands in Greece.\n",

            "@William: You’re probably correct. I had forgotten that they built a garage on Mercer Island. My frame of reference is a decade old, when I bicycled past both park and rides every morning during commuting hours. So that’s who’s behind the new gosh-awful Sound Transit maps. Is that a LRT vehicle I see in that picture of the Sea-Tac arrivals? The track is inches away. The station is the better part of a mile. Not sure I understand your point–the proposed terminal expansion will be quite close to the southward extension of Link, as it’s located to the west of the existing A concourse (between there and 99, which is not much more than 100m). Now the station–yeah, that’s a different story.\n",

            "M. virginiana is not the most well known native but 'Moonglow' may be a selection that changes all that. Vigorous growing and disease resistant, 'Moonglow' has big, deep green foliage that covers this wide, rounded plant, providing a superb backdrop to massive, creamy-white, fragrant flowers that emerge continually from June through the rest of the summer. This tree makes a large but beautiful specimen and also provides tons of shelter for nesting native birds along with an invaluable food source from the red berries contained in the big seed pods this plant produces. 'Moonglow' tolerates moist soils and will grow well in full sun or partial shade. As we continue this series, beBATONROUGE chooses to share Raymond A. Jetson’s “What I’m Reading” interview.
