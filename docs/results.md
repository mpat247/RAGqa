## Evaluation Methodology

### Ground Truth Comparison

Created ground truth dataset with 20 questions and expected answers:

```text
Sample Ground Truth:
1. "How many scrolls were in the grand library of Zandoria?" → "50,000"
2. "Where can the bluefire crystal be found?" → "caves of mount eldoria"
3. "In what year did Dr. Helena Carter win the Nobel Prize?" → "1998"
```

### Token-Level F1 Calculation

The evaluation computes F1 score by:
1. Tokenizing predicted answers and ground truth
2. Finding common tokens between prediction and context sentences
3. Calculating precision, recall, and F1 score
4. Selecting best-matching sentence in retrieved context

### Metrics Framework

**Primary Metrics:**
- Token-level F1 score for answer quality
- Retrieval similarity scores for relevance
- QA model confidence for reliability

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Processing time and memory usage
- System throughput and scalability
- Error handling and robustness

## Comparative Analysis

### Baseline Performance

Without retrieval augmentation, pure QA models struggle with:

- No access to external knowledge
- Poor performance on domain-specific questions

### RAG System Advantages

Our implementation provides:
- Access to large document corpus (91,561 chunks)
- Semantic similarity-based retrieval
- Context-aware answer extraction
- Scalable architecture for larger datasets

## Technical Performance

### Computational Efficiency

- **Embedding Model:** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- **Batch Size:** 512 chunks for optimal memory usage
- **Index Type:** FAISS IndexFlatL2 for exact search
- **Storage:** Persistent embeddings and index for quick startup

### Scalability Results

- Successfully processed 91,561 document chunks
- Maintained consistent performance across query set
- Memory-efficient implementation handles large corpora
- FAISS indexing scales to larger document collections

## Error Analysis

### Common Issues

1. **Multi-hop Reasoning:** Questions requiring information from multiple chunks
2. **Numerical Precision:** Exact number matching challenges
3. **Context Ambiguity:** Multiple valid answers in different contexts

### Mitigation Strategies

- Increased chunk overlap for better context preservation
- Top-k retrieval (k=50) to capture multiple relevant passages
- Confidence scoring for answer quality assessment

## Future Improvements

### Short-term Enhancements

- Fine-tune chunk size and overlap parameters
- Implement answer re-ranking algorithms
- Add multi-document reasoning capabilities

### Long-term Developments

- Integration with larger language models
