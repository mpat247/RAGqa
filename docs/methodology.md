# Methodology

## Project Approach

This project implements a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for question answering. The methodology follows best practices in information retrieval and natural language processing.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Data Preparation

**Objective:** Prepare text corpus for semantic search

**Process:**
1. Load raw documents from `FinalProjectDocuments.txt`
2. Apply text normalization (lowercase, whitespace cleanup)
3. Basic validation and character encoding handling

**Technical Details:**
- Input size: Large text corpus with mixed content
- Preprocessing removes formatting artifacts
- UTF-8 encoding ensures proper character handling

### Step 2: Document Chunking

**Objective:** Split documents into manageable, semantically coherent segments

**Strategy:** Sentence-based chunking with overlap
- Chunk size: 150 words maximum
- Overlap: 1 sentence between adjacent chunks
- Tokenization: NLTK sentence tokenizer

**Rationale:**
- Preserves semantic coherence within chunks
- Overlap prevents information loss at boundaries
- 150-word limit balances context and precision

**Output:** 91,561 text chunks

### Step 3: Embedding Generation

**Model Selection:** SentenceTransformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Vector dimension: 384
- Pre-trained on diverse text data
- Optimized for semantic similarity tasks

**Implementation:**
- Batch processing (512 chunks per batch)
- Memory-efficient processing to handle large corpus
- Persistent storage of embeddings for reuse

**Performance:** Complete embedding generation in reasonable time

### Step 4: Vector Indexing

**Technology:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Index type: IndexFlatL2 (exact search)
- Distance metric: L2 (Euclidean) distance
- No compression for maximum accuracy

**Benefits:**
- Fast similarity search
- Exact nearest neighbor retrieval
- Scalable to large document collections

### Step 5: Question Processing Pipeline

**Retrieval Phase:**
1. Encode user question using same SentenceTransformer
2. Search FAISS index for top-k similar chunks (k=50)
3. Rank chunks by similarity score

**QA Phase:**
1. Apply RoBERTa QA model to each retrieved chunk
2. Extract answer candidates with confidence scores
3. Select best answer based on QA model confidence

### Step 6: Evaluation Framework

**Primary Metric:** Token-level F1 score
- Compares predicted answer tokens with context sentences
- Finds best-matching sentence in retrieved chunks
- Provides interpretable relevance measure

**Additional Metrics:**
- QA model confidence scores
- Retrieval similarity scores
- Overall accuracy against ground truth answers

## Technical Decisions

### Why SentenceTransformer?
- Specifically designed for semantic similarity
- Good balance of quality and efficiency
- Strong performance on retrieval tasks

### Why FAISS?
- Industry-standard vector search library
- Exact search guarantees for baseline performance
- Easy to scale and optimize

### Why RoBERTa for QA?
- State-of-the-art extractive QA performance
- Pre-trained on SQuAD dataset
- Reliable confidence scoring

### Chunking Strategy Justification
- Sentence-based splits preserve meaning
- 150-word limit balances context and specificity
- Overlap prevents context loss at boundaries

## Experimental Design

### Test Questions
- 20 diverse questions covering different topics
- Mix of factual and descriptive queries
- Ground truth answers provided for evaluation

### Evaluation Process
1. Process all 20 questions through complete pipeline
2. Record predicted answers and confidence scores
3. Compute token-level F1 against retrieved context
4. Calculate overall performance metrics

### Performance Optimization
- Batch processing for memory efficiency
- Persistent storage of computed embeddings
- FAISS index caching for fast startup

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps
1. Chunk quality inspection (sample review)
2. Embedding dimension verification
3. Index integrity checks
4. QA model output validation

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of empty or invalid inputs
- Fallback mechanisms for low-confidence scenarios
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Results Validation

### Ground Truth Comparison
- Manual verification of answer quality
- Token-level F1 scoring for objective measurement
- Confidence score correlation analysis

### System Performance
- End-to-end processing time measurement
- Memory usage monitoring
- Scalability assessment

This methodology ensures reproducible results and provides a solid foundation for question answering system development.
